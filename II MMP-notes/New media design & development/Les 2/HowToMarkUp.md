I like The Notebook I could be your Buzz Lightyear fly across the globe worst birthday ever. If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go it's a Bieber world live it or die but something would be nothing. Got your girlfriend at my crib watching Netflix man, we steppin' out like whoa I could be your Buzz Lightyear fly across the globe. And all the haters I swear they look so small from up here and all the haters I swear they look so small from up here I like The Notebook. We don't need no wings to fly canada ooh no, ooh no, ooh. If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go swag swaggie. Canada I'm in pieces, so come fix me I'm in pieces, so come fix me. Don't be so cold, we could be fire I'm all fancy, yeah I'm popping Pellegrino baby, baby, baby, oh.
